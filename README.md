## MVVM Architecture

 Our application embraces the MVVM architecture, enhancing code readability and facilitating maintenance. MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel, separating the user interface (View) and application data (Model), and connecting them through the ViewModel.
The MVVM architecture ensures modularity in the code, empowering developers to manage user interface design and business logic more effectively. The underlying MVVM architecture of ChatCraft enhances the overall performance and sustainability of the application.
As a result, ChatCraft not only features a user-friendly interface but also operates seamlessly with a robust codebase, providing a smooth user experience.
